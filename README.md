Key Aspects:
Facial Feature Detection:
OpenCV is employed to detect and extract facial features such as eyes, mouth, and facial contours from images or video streams. These features serve as input to the model for recognizing emotional states.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
CNNs, implemented using PyTorch, are used for processing the facial features and identifying patterns that correspond to different emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. CNNs excel in handling image data, making them ideal for this task.

Model Training:
The model is trained using TensorFlow, leveraging a large dataset of labeled facial images with various emotional expressions. The goal is to develop a robust model that can generalize well to new data. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping are applied to improve model performance.

Real-Time Emotion Detection:
The system is designed to perform real-time emotion detection using camera input, making it applicable for various use cases, including customer service, mental health assessment, and human-computer interaction.
